>It's pretty hard to remember maybe, but if you go back to the early industrial revolutions, the late 19th century, wage labor was considered essentially the same as slavery. The only difference was that it was supposed to be temporary. That was a slogan of the Republican party: opposition to wage slavery.

>We're the party who opposes slavery and who opposes wage slavery.

>What if I told you insane was working fifty hours a week in some office for fifty years at the end of which they tell you to piss off; ending up in some retirement village hoping to die before suffering the indignity of trying to make it to the toilet on time?

>The only difference as compared with the old, outspoken slavery is this, that the worker of today seems to be free because he is not sold once for all, but piecemeal by the day, the week, the year, and because no one owner sells him to another, but he is forced to sell himself in this way instead, being the slave of no particular person, but of the whole property-holding class.

>It must be acknowledged that our worker emerges from the process of production looking different from when he entered it.

>Formerly the master selected the slave; today the slave selects his master

>It is the same among us: people of our day consider the position of the laborer to be a natural, inevitable economic condition, and they do not call it slavery. And as, at the end of the Eighteenth Century, the people of Europe began little by little to understand that what formerly seemed a natural and inevitable form of economic life-namely, the position of peasants who were completely in the power of their lords-was wrong, unjust and immoral, and demanded alteration, so now people today are beginning to understand that the position of hired workmen, and of the working classes in general, which formerly seemed quite right and quite normal, is not what it should be, and demands alteration.

>it is a fact that a commercial trust differs from a typical traditional trust in that it arises out of a contract rather than the transfer of property by way of gift. The contract defines the parameters of the trust. Trusts are now commonly part of the machinery used in many commercial transactions, for example across the spectrum of wholesale financial markets, where they serve a useful bridging role between the parties involved. Commercial trusts may differ widely in their purpose and content, but they have in common that the trustee's duties are likely to be closely defined and may be of limited duration.

>In contrast, in people who were not previously vaccinated, or if the previous vaccine strain cross-reacts minimally with the current vaccine strain, the effectiveness of the current vaccine (even if not a great match to the circulating strain) will be higher. This "negative interference"(where vaccinated individuals may be at increased risk for other respiratory viruses because they do not receive the non-specific immunity associated with natural infection) between vaccines arises from reactivation of the memory responses that are conserved between vaccine strains at the expense of responses to new antigen.

>coercive tactics increasingly include use of the web and social media for unremitting personalized harassment of individuals. They also include systematic frivolous legal challenges through the courts

>Although they underwent the pathological process of pneumonia, like most COVID-19 patients, they were blind spots for control interventions based on symptomatic case screening because they never developed symptoms. We did not find chronic asymptomatic carriers in our cohort. There have been no previous cases of human chronic carriers of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV

>Live vaccines, such as measles, MMR and Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), tend to lower risk (providing a protective influence)

>Live attenuated vaccines take more time to develop because they rely on the amplification and weakening of the pathogenic attributes of the original virus. However, they can induce an immune response similar to that induced by a natural infection targeting several viral antigens, and are thus presumably more effective than the other vaccine types, although further studies are needed to provide the necessary evidence. Therefore, live attenuated vaccines are expected to be one of the most effective vaccines against different variants that may arise.

>ACE2 expression is upregulated in the brain vasculature in association with dementia and hypertension, both of which are risk factors for bad outcomes from COVID-19

A paper involving postmortem examination of testicles of six male COVID-19 patients found microscopic evidence of spike protein in interstitial cells in the testes of patients with damaged testicles (Achua et al., 2021).

>The plausible reason for our hypothesis is that the presence of numerous bioactive agents in different parts of plants that may synergistically exert polypharmacological actions in regulating immune-inflammatory axis in COVID-19. Our proposition is to scientifically contemplate the therapeutic perspective and prospect of Echinacea on infection, immunity, and inflammation with a potential in COVID-19 to limit the severity and progression of the disease. Based on the clinical usage for respiratory infections, and relative safety in humans, further studies for the evidence-based approach to COVID-19 are needed. We do hope that Echinacea could be a candidate agent for immunomodulation in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

>There are several reports on the antiviral activity of numerous plants against highly pathogenic viruses, including coronaviruses. The plants of Echinacea genus are one among those plants, which are well known for their potential antiviral activity against pathogenic coronaviruses. Echinacea angustifolia (E. angustifolia) is one of the popular medical plants belonging to this genus with medicinal value, including antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities.

>This is one scenario that scientists foresee for SARS-CoV-2. The virus sticks around, but once people develop some immunity to it — either through natural infection or vaccination — they won't come down with severe symptoms.

>All laws are selective to some extent, but categories of selection are of paramount concern when a law has the incidental effect of burdening religious practice

Now, our economics is worldwide and his economics is regional and about to collapse.

>By 1779, Hope, who was described by the Virginia Gazette as 'Caesar, the famous barber of York', had been freed. Enslaved for 36 years, his owner in 1779 petitioned the Virginia Assembly to set him free. This became possible thanks to the fame he had earned for his occupation. Reports said at least 32 residents of Yorktown supported Hope's freedom. Five years after becoming a free man, he shed the slave name 'Caesar' and started doing business in Williamsburg under the name John Hope. He also purchased and freed his own son, Aberdeen. In the 1790s, Hope purchased a lot on Shockoe Hill, a few blocks west of the Capitol building. While accumulating property, he got married and had two children. Five years ago, the life and journey of Hope inspired a new Colonial Williamsburg site. Colonial Williamsburg has since the 1920s served as a museum and education site, and it is very popular in the American South. In October 2017, it opened Hope's Barber Shop to interpret the remarkable story of Hope.
