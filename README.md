>Radical can mean going to the root cause of injustice.

>The dirty data sends cops into neighborhoods to target everyone who lives there, just because they have the misfortune of living in an area where crime is prevalent. If the software was any "smarter," it would just send cops to prisons where criminal activity is the highest.

>Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside while still alive.

>Every time somebody hurts you, pick up a book.

>Remember your humanity, and forget the rest. If you can do so, the way lies open to a new Paradise; if you cannot, there lies before you the risk of universal death.

>Seeking perfection, we see what our dreams and hopes might look like. We realize they come as a gift through no power of our own, and if we lose them, isn't that almost worse than never having had them in the first place?

>If you are talking about sport, that is one thing. But when you are talking about combat – as it is – well then, baby, you'd better train every part of your body.

>Gung fu is so extraordinary because it is nothing at all special, it is simply the direct expression of one's feeling with the minimum of lines and energy.

>Sometimes we must fall, sometimes we will rise - some must be hurt while others have fortune, for that is the only way we can learn to rely on one another. As one is blessed, it is his privilege to help those whose lives are not as easy.

>Once it has become a crime to tell the truth, then we will have tyranny.

>The mass of an object remains the same throughout the universe, whereas its weight is a function of gravity on any given planet.

>The distinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relations of objects, nor is perceiv’d by reason.

>Distraction is an emotion-focused coping strategy because it diverts the focus of attention away from unpleasant stimuli by manipulating the environment. Distraction interventions are effective because individuals can concentrate on pleasant or interesting stimuli instead of focusing on unpleasant symptoms. Techniques such as humor, relaxation, music, imagery, and VR all are classified as distraction interventions, and they can relieve physical symptoms such as pain, anxiety, nausea, and stress.

>If you receive a bribe, include it in your income.

>If you steal property, you must report its FMV in your income in the year you steal it unless in the same year, you return it to its rightful owner.

>What if I told you insane was working fifty hours a week in some office for fifty years at the end of which they tell you to piss off; ending up in some retirement village hoping to die before suffering the indignity of trying to make it to the toilet on time?

>It's pretty hard to remember maybe, but if you go back to the early industrial revolutions, the late 19th century, wage labor was considered essentially the same as slavery. The only difference was that it was supposed to be temporary. That was a slogan of the Republican party: opposition to wage slavery.

>We're the party who opposes slavery and who opposes wage slavery.

>What if I told you insane was working fifty hours a week in some office for fifty years at the end of which they tell you to piss off; ending up in some retirement village hoping to die before suffering the indignity of trying to make it to the toilet on time?

>The only difference as compared with the old, outspoken slavery is this, that the worker of today seems to be free because he is not sold once for all, but piecemeal by the day, the week, the year, and because no one owner sells him to another, but he is forced to sell himself in this way instead, being the slave of no particular person, but of the whole property-holding class.

>It must be acknowledged that our worker emerges from the process of production looking different from when he entered it.

>Formerly the master selected the slave; today the slave selects his master

>It is the same among us: people of our day consider the position of the laborer to be a natural, inevitable economic condition, and they do not call it slavery. And as, at the end of the Eighteenth Century, the people of Europe began little by little to understand that what formerly seemed a natural and inevitable form of economic life-namely, the position of peasants who were completely in the power of their lords-was wrong, unjust and immoral, and demanded alteration, so now people today are beginning to understand that the position of hired workmen, and of the working classes in general, which formerly seemed quite right and quite normal, is not what it should be, and demands alteration.

>Society forms a screen between nature and man.

>If I could start from scratch, I'd sign to Def Jam...

>Ignorance allied with power is the most ferocious enemy justice can have

>The attitude is that IF you can pay the typical mortgage off in full, you are then free and easy. Sorry, not so. You will ALWAYS have the typical costs of upkeep and repair. But that's not all. Even more onerous are all those property TAXES that comes with home ownership. And this is one payment you HAVE to make, or you will lose that home due to tax foreclosure. So in the end...you really own nothing. You are just a glorified renter.

>we will get out when you prove we will be boiled alive

>You are replaceable to your company, but not to your loved ones

>You cannot write an email while making a presentation

>Ultimately, Mary was traced to a total of around 50 typhoid cases and three deaths. This is tragic, no doubt, but George Soper himself later admitted that this was not as large a toll as other carriers who were discovered after Mary received a life sentence in quarantine.

>In its very earliest stages, the symptoms of the deadly flu could mimic those of the milder strain of influenza and even the common cold. Moreover, those familiar with the publicity surrounding the famous Typhoid Mary knew that some diseases could be spread by healthy carriers.

>it is a fact that a commercial trust differs from a typical traditional trust in that it arises out of a contract rather than the transfer of property by way of gift. The contract defines the parameters of the trust. Trusts are now commonly part of the machinery used in many commercial transactions, for example across the spectrum of wholesale financial markets, where they serve a useful bridging role between the parties involved. Commercial trusts may differ widely in their purpose and content, but they have in common that the trustee's duties are likely to be closely defined and may be of limited duration.
