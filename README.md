>Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else's opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation.

>Radical can mean going to the root cause of injustice.

>The dirty data sends cops into neighborhoods to target everyone who lives there, just because they have the misfortune of living in an area where crime is prevalent. If the software was any "smarter," it would just send cops to prisons where criminal activity is the highest.

>Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside while still alive.

>Every time somebody hurts you, pick up a book.

>Remember your humanity, and forget the rest. If you can do so, the way lies open to a new Paradise; if you cannot, there lies before you the risk of universal death.

>Seeking perfection, we see what our dreams and hopes might look like. We realize they come as a gift through no power of our own, and if we lose them, isn't that almost worse than never having had them in the first place?

>If you are talking about sport, that is one thing. But when you are talking about combat – as it is – well then, baby, you'd better train every part of your body.

>Gung fu is so extraordinary because it is nothing at all special, it is simply the direct expression of one's feeling with the minimum of lines and energy.

>Sometimes we must fall, sometimes we will rise - some must be hurt while others have fortune, for that is the only way we can learn to rely on one another. As one is blessed, it is his privilege to help those whose lives are not as easy.

>Once it has become a crime to tell the truth, then we will have tyranny.

>The mass of an object remains the same throughout the universe, whereas its weight is a function of gravity on any given planet.

>The distinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relations of objects, nor is perceiv’d by reason.

>Distraction is an emotion-focused coping strategy because it diverts the focus of attention away from unpleasant stimuli by manipulating the environment. Distraction interventions are effective because individuals can concentrate on pleasant or interesting stimuli instead of focusing on unpleasant symptoms. Techniques such as humor, relaxation, music, imagery, and VR all are classified as distraction interventions, and they can relieve physical symptoms such as pain, anxiety, nausea, and stress.

>As a result, it's not known if a person who is vaccinated could be a carrier of the COVID-19 virus and spread it to others, even if he or she doesn't become sick. More research is needed to determine if you are still contagious after being vaccinated.

>If you receive a bribe, include it in your income.

>If you steal property, you must report its FMV in your income in the year you steal it unless in the same year, you return it to its rightful owner.

>What if I told you insane was working fifty hours a week in some office for fifty years at the end of which they tell you to piss off; ending up in some retirement village hoping to die before suffering the indignity of trying to make it to the toilet on time?

>It's pretty hard to remember maybe, but if you go back to the early industrial revolutions, the late 19th century, wage labor was considered essentially the same as slavery. The only difference was that it was supposed to be temporary. That was a slogan of the Republican party: opposition to wage slavery.

>We're the party who opposes slavery and who opposes wage slavery.

>What if I told you insane was working fifty hours a week in some office for fifty years at the end of which they tell you to piss off; ending up in some retirement village hoping to die before suffering the indignity of trying to make it to the toilet on time?

>The only difference as compared with the old, outspoken slavery is this, that the worker of today seems to be free because he is not sold once for all, but piecemeal by the day, the week, the year, and because no one owner sells him to another, but he is forced to sell himself in this way instead, being the slave of no particular person, but of the whole property-holding class.

>It must be acknowledged that our worker emerges from the process of production looking different from when he entered it.

>Formerly the master selected the slave; today the slave selects his master

>It is the same among us: people of our day consider the position of the laborer to be a natural, inevitable economic condition, and they do not call it slavery. And as, at the end of the Eighteenth Century, the people of Europe began little by little to understand that what formerly seemed a natural and inevitable form of economic life-namely, the position of peasants who were completely in the power of their lords-was wrong, unjust and immoral, and demanded alteration, so now people today are beginning to understand that the position of hired workmen, and of the working classes in general, which formerly seemed quite right and quite normal, is not what it should be, and demands alteration.

>It's not an odd view, that there isn't much difference between selling yourself and renting yourself.

>You have a choice between starving or selling yourself into tyranny

>Society forms a screen between nature and man.

>If you want to learn to swim jump into the water. On dry land no frame of mind is ever going to help you.

>Everyone is learning the crawl and the backstroke on dry land, but no one ever gets in the water because it's too dangerous.

>If I could start from scratch, I'd sign to Def Jam...

>Ignorance allied with power is the most ferocious enemy justice can have

>The attitude is that IF you can pay the typical mortgage off in full, you are then free and easy. Sorry, not so. You will ALWAYS have the typical costs of upkeep and repair. But that's not all. Even more onerous are all those property TAXES that comes with home ownership. And this is one payment you HAVE to make, or you will lose that home due to tax foreclosure. So in the end...you really own nothing. You are just a glorified renter.

>we will get out when you prove we will be boiled alive

>You cannot write an email while making a presentation

>Ultimately, Mary was traced to a total of around 50 typhoid cases and three deaths. This is tragic, no doubt, but George Soper himself later admitted that this was not as large a toll as other carriers who were discovered after Mary received a life sentence in quarantine.

>In its very earliest stages, the symptoms of the deadly flu could mimic those of the milder strain of influenza and even the common cold. Moreover, those familiar with the publicity surrounding the famous Typhoid Mary knew that some diseases could be spread by healthy carriers.

>it is a fact that a commercial trust differs from a typical traditional trust in that it arises out of a contract rather than the transfer of property by way of gift. The contract defines the parameters of the trust. Trusts are now commonly part of the machinery used in many commercial transactions, for example across the spectrum of wholesale financial markets, where they serve a useful bridging role between the parties involved. Commercial trusts may differ widely in their purpose and content, but they have in common that the trustee's duties are likely to be closely defined and may be of limited duration.

>Mathematical simulations show that this virus-virus interaction is likely to have a population-wide effect as an increasing prevalence of rhinovirus will reduce the number of new COVID-19 cases.

>The Health Ministry of the archipelago off of Africa's east coast said Monday that the number of active cases had more than doubled since last week to 2,486 people, and 37% of those have received two vaccine doses.

>Workers, as sellers of their own labor, almost always faced monopsonistic exploitation from employers, the buyers of their labor

>We flatter our rich, connected, controlling members of the society by the language we currently use. This wasn’t always the case. In earlier times we used terms such as robber barons, monopolist, fat cat, or tory of industry. These words and phrases had a derogatory weight to them.

>Overcoming recidivism is not a matter of achieving external, social goals, but more so, one of freeing oneself from internal conditions that have been repressed and unconsciously driving the mind, emotions, and will. This must be understood.

>Isn't it wonderful to imagine that you've been hurt, then wake up and you've not.

>Humans can have 'knowledge about knowledge'

>If you sit around starting to feel sorry for yourself, and blaming everyone else for your position in life, it is like being in quicksand. In quicksand, if you start flailing all about and panicking with each movement you go in deeper, but if you just stay calm and look about, chances are you'll see a twig or something you can reach to pull yourself out. Or, if you stay there long enough someone will come and rescue you.

>Stop trying to be liked by everybody. You don't even like every body.

>Without sales the entire business model is an exercise in frustration

>property ownership, capital, credit, and markets. When considered as a whole, these barriers constitute economic exclusion, not just economic inequality.

>The act of war is the last option of a democracy, taken when there is a grave threat to our national security.

>If you don't have the time to do it right, when will you have the time to do it over?

>The Nintendo way of adapting technology is not to look for the state of the art but to utilize mature technology that can be mass-produced cheaply.

>The essence of games is competition, and I think that's a remnant of our past as animals, and the competition of the survival of the fittest.

>I can't make myself make an outline, but instead jot down countless notes that I never look at, obviously an attempt to stall the inevitable.

>Farming is difficult to make profitable on large scales because inputs are expensive.

>Circumstances seemingly out of my control accentuated gaping discrepancies between who I was portrayed to be and who I was in private

>Anecdotes tell us what the data can't

>The person who starts the business is seldom the person who can grow it, and that person is seldom the one who can lead a much larger company. 

>Treatments that take years and billions of dollars to develop are bought in vast volumes by governments with a keen eye on price and are often effective for life after a single dose. That model of extraordinarily high start-up costs, thin margins and minimal repeat business doesn't represent an attractive way for companies to allocate capital.

>In contrast, in people who were not previously vaccinated, or if the previous vaccine strain cross-reacts minimally with the current vaccine strain, the effectiveness of the current vaccine (even if not a great match to the circulating strain) will be higher. This "negative interference" between vaccines arises from reactivation of the memory responses that are conserved between vaccine strains at the expense of responses to new antigen.

>coercive tactics increasingly include use of the web and social media for unremitting personalized harassment of individuals. They also include systematic frivolous legal challenges through the courts

>Although they underwent the pathological process of pneumonia, like most COVID-19 patients, they were blind spots for control interventions based on symptomatic case screening because they never developed symptoms. We did not find chronic asymptomatic carriers in our cohort. There have been no previous cases of human chronic carriers of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV

>Live vaccines, such as measles, MMR and Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), tend to lower risk (providing a protective influence)

>Live attenuated vaccines take more time to develop because they rely on the amplification and weakening of the pathogenic attributes of the original virus. However, they can induce an immune response similar to that induced by a natural infection targeting several viral antigens, and are thus presumably more effective than the other vaccine types, although further studies are needed to provide the necessary evidence. Therefore, live attenuated vaccines are expected to be one of the most effective vaccines against different variants that may arise.

>We didn't exist in the other papers. We were neither born, we didn't get married, we didn't die, we didn't fight in any wars, we never participated in anything of a scientific achievement. We were truly invisible unless we committed a crime.

>N95 and P2 masks work best when they are fit-tested, and these masks will be in limited supply during the next pandemic.

>Knowing how to bring water to one of the driest places on earth means that you hold the very key to life itself.

>ACE2 expression is upregulated in the brain vasculature in association with dementia and hypertension, both of which are risk factors for bad outcomes from COVID-19

>Several studies have now shown that the coronavirus spike protein is able to gain access to cells in the testes via the ACE2 receptor, and disrupt male reproduction (Navarra et al., 2020; Wang and Xu, 2020). A paper involving postmortem examination of testicles of six male COVID-19 patients found microscopic evidence of spike protein in interstitial cells in the testes of patients with damaged testicles (Achua et al., 2021).

>The plausible reason for our hypothesis is that the presence of numerous bioactive agents in different parts of plants that may synergistically exert polypharmacological actions in regulating immune-inflammatory axis in COVID-19. Our proposition is to scientifically contemplate the therapeutic perspective and prospect of Echinacea on infection, immunity, and inflammation with a potential in COVID-19 to limit the severity and progression of the disease. Based on the clinical usage for respiratory infections, and relative safety in humans, further studies for the evidence-based approach to COVID-19 are needed. We do hope that Echinacea could be a candidate agent for immunomodulation in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

>There are several reports on the antiviral activity of numerous plants against highly pathogenic viruses, including coronaviruses. The plants of Echinacea genus are one among those plants, which are well known for their potential antiviral activity against pathogenic coronaviruses. Echinacea angustifolia (E. angustifolia) is one of the popular medical plants belonging to this genus with medicinal value, including antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities.

>This is one scenario that scientists foresee for SARS-CoV-2. The virus sticks around, but once people develop some immunity to it — either through natural infection or vaccination — they won't come down with severe symptoms.

>All laws are selective to some extent, but categories of selection are of paramount concern when a law has the incidental effect of burdening religious practice

>Proponents of the criminal policy of herd immunity have seized on Singapore as an example to push for "opening up" and "living with Covid" once high vaccination rates have been achieved
