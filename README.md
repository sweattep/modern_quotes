And as, at the end of the Eighteenth Century, the people of Europe began little by little to understand that what formerly seemed a natural and inevitable form of economic life-namely, the position of peasants who were completely in the power of their lords-was wrong, unjust and immoral, and demanded alteration, so now people today are beginning to understand that the position of hired workmen, and of the working classes in general, which formerly seemed quite right and quite normal, is not what it should be, and demands alteration.

>Ultimately, Mary was traced to a total of around 50 typhoid cases and three deaths. This is tragic, no doubt, but George Soper himself later admitted that this was not as large a toll as other carriers who were discovered after Mary received a life sentence in quarantine.

>In its very earliest stages, the symptoms of the deadly flu could mimic those of the milder strain of influenza and even the common cold. Moreover, those familiar with the publicity surrounding the famous Typhoid Mary knew that some diseases could be spread by healthy carriers.

>it is a fact that a commercial trust differs from a typical traditional trust in that it arises out of a contract rather than the transfer of property by way of gift. The contract defines the parameters of the trust. Trusts are now commonly part of the machinery used in many commercial transactions, for example across the spectrum of wholesale financial markets, where they serve a useful bridging role between the parties involved. Commercial trusts may differ widely in their purpose and content, but they have in common that the trustee's duties are likely to be closely defined and may be of limited duration.

>In contrast, in people who were not previously vaccinated, or if the previous vaccine strain cross-reacts minimally with the current vaccine strain, the effectiveness of the current vaccine (even if not a great match to the circulating strain) will be higher. This "negative interference"(where vaccinated individuals may be at increased risk for other respiratory viruses because they do not receive the non-specific immunity associated with natural infection) between vaccines arises from reactivation of the memory responses that are conserved between vaccine strains at the expense of responses to new antigen.

>coercive tactics increasingly include use of the web and social media for unremitting personalized harassment of individuals. They also include systematic frivolous legal challenges through the courts

>Although they underwent the pathological process of pneumonia, like most COVID-19 patients, they were blind spots for control interventions based on symptomatic case screening because they never developed symptoms. We did not find chronic asymptomatic carriers in our cohort. There have been no previous cases of human chronic carriers of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV

>Live vaccines, such as measles, MMR and Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), tend to lower risk (providing a protective influence)

>Live attenuated vaccines take more time to develop because they rely on the amplification and weakening of the pathogenic attributes of the original virus. However, they can induce an immune response similar to that induced by a natural infection targeting several viral antigens, and are thus presumably more effective than the other vaccine types, although further studies are needed to provide the necessary evidence. Therefore, live attenuated vaccines are expected to be one of the most effective vaccines against different variants that may arise.

>ACE2 expression is upregulated in the brain vasculature in association with dementia and hypertension, both of which are risk factors for bad outcomes from COVID-19

>Several studies have now shown that the coronavirus spike protein is able to gain access to cells in the testes via the ACE2 receptor, and disrupt male reproduction (Navarra et al., 2020; Wang and Xu, 2020). A paper involving postmortem examination of testicles of six male COVID-19 patients found microscopic evidence of spike protein in interstitial cells in the testes of patients with damaged testicles (Achua et al., 2021).

>The plausible reason for our hypothesis is that the presence of numerous bioactive agents in different parts of plants that may synergistically exert polypharmacological actions in regulating immune-inflammatory axis in COVID-19. Our proposition is to scientifically contemplate the therapeutic perspective and prospect of Echinacea on infection, immunity, and inflammation with a potential in COVID-19 to limit the severity and progression of the disease. Based on the clinical usage for respiratory infections, and relative safety in humans, further studies for the evidence-based approach to COVID-19 are needed. We do hope that Echinacea could be a candidate agent for immunomodulation in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

>There are several reports on the antiviral activity of numerous plants against highly pathogenic viruses, including coronaviruses. The plants of Echinacea genus are one among those plants, which are well known for their potential antiviral activity against pathogenic coronaviruses. Echinacea angustifolia (E. angustifolia) is one of the popular medical plants belonging to this genus with medicinal value, including antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities.

> There is a window of opportunity for teaching and learning; the task is to know when it appears and exploit it.

>This is one scenario that scientists foresee for SARS-CoV-2. The virus sticks around, but once people develop some immunity to it — either through natural infection or vaccination — they won't come down with severe symptoms.

>All laws are selective to some extent, but categories of selection are of paramount concern when a law has the incidental effect of burdening religious practice

>By 1779, Hope, who was described by the Virginia Gazette as 'Caesar, the famous barber of York', had been freed. Enslaved for 36 years, his owner in 1779 petitioned the Virginia Assembly to set him free. This became possible thanks to the fame he had earned for his occupation. Reports said at least 32 residents of Yorktown supported Hope's freedom. Five years after becoming a free man, he shed the slave name 'Caesar' and started doing business in Williamsburg under the name John Hope. He also purchased and freed his own son, Aberdeen. In the 1790s, Hope purchased a lot on Shockoe Hill, a few blocks west of the Capitol building. While accumulating property, he got married and had two children. Five years ago, the life and journey of Hope inspired a new Colonial Williamsburg site. Colonial Williamsburg has since the 1920s served as a museum and education site, and it is very popular in the American South. In October 2017, it opened Hope's Barber Shop to interpret the remarkable story of Hope.

>It is given to a fortunate few to be born at the right time, in the right place, with the right talents.

>When we talk about mental illnesses or depression, anxiety, and stress, we often talk about those things as if they're just chemical imbalances. It makes sense that if you're struggling to pay bills or you're worried about whether your children are going to eat that that causes some stress and anxiety for you.

>The only thing he's not scripted to say or do is when he uses the bathroom, whether it's defecation or urination.

>we will forever be distracted with possessions and trinkets and title

>take your favorite records and write your version of your favorite records with your words on that track

>This is a conclusion revolting alike to common sense and common experience. Besides there is good reason to suspect a political motive for the charge. A motive other than the one they would have the world believe. It comes in close connection with the effort now being made to disfranchise the colored man. It comes from men who regard it innocent to lie

>This is a big deal because it challenges the traditional Western idea that classical art was just plain white marble and shows how important colour was to ancient Greek artists.

>must be the devil...can't be rockefeller

>we willfully remain the humble servants of every one else's iDEAS except our own

>A serious challenge, which we face in today’s world, is for each person, whether literate or illiterate, `to say what one means and mean what one says,` a statement, which is alien to institutional logic and to career-oriented professionals.

>love often feels like a game we need to win

>Its cobbling together of nested functions and dynamic objects was brilliant. I spent a decade trying to correct its flaws. I had a minor success with ES5. But since then, there has been strong interest in further bloating the language instead of making it better. So JavaScript, like the other dinosaur languages, has become a barrier to progress.

>While the virus is here to stay, it's believed that most of the world's population has now been infected by it and therefore has built immunity to it.

>protect yourselves, protect your family, leave a legacy

>meet real people where they are in their real lives

>point the way out of the warfares between labor and capital

>The law which deprives him of the badge of citizenship, changes at once his legal status and cuts him off from respect. His disqualification as an elector shuts him out of the jury box in courts where what few rights he has left are adjudicated and his grievances redressed. His disqualification as an elector and as a juror discredits him as a witness. In the states which have adopted these disfranchising constitutions, more than three hundred thousand citizens have been thereby disqualified as jurors. This is all the more outrageous, because in the same states advantage has been taken in criminal legislation

>labor must be managed, and control must be asserted

>A free man, yet penniless and homeless. A man of toil, but one whose own and whose ancestral toil had created a material and social grandeur which now mocked at his poverty and arrogantly denied him a share in its blessings. A free man, but ignorant, the greatest curse imposed by his former status which had contributed to the enlightenment of others. A freeman, but helpless in the face of an impending persecution. He, whose labor had contributed to the comfort and social happiness of others

>Now, a supplement has to be proven dangerous -- in other words, people have to get sick or die -- before it can be banned.

>sources close to Ricky Rubio tell me that Mundo Deportivo is lying. But still, my source is not as reliable as yours

>E3 was irrelevant far before COVID. The rise of streaming and online influencers severely undercut the allure of the industry event for the consumer side of it. Gamescom, Twitchcon, BlizzCon, etc and so many other substitutes were chipping away at the edifice from all angles to the point it was way economically unsustainable.

>excess accumulation of visceral fat (a high visceral fat z-score) at any given BMI was significantly associated with increased risk of CVD and T2D.

>If James Dean was a rapper, he would be me

>He represents euthanasia, to die slowly, to die painlessly, you know what i mean

>We need more thinkers

>When we allow the interests of others to direct our goals and vision, we become subordinate to our own ideals.

>feeling unwell is just that: feeling unwell. To attach judgement without understanding is cruel and often wrong. If a woman is crying, is she therefore depressed? A yes answer is biased and unscientific. Finally and perhaps the most important piece? Individual instinct. I'd ask the individual (or self if it's me) what I think is happening. Statistically, patients are usually more accurate as to sources of discomfort or suffering.

>Over Father's Day weekend, I experienced a health scare related to my heart. It was unexpected and served as a reminder of staying vigilant about our physical well-being, even when we are feeling fine.

>Whatsit called, the thingamajig that flummoxed you last time we went to the pub, almost got into a brouhaha, and had to skedaddle when the young whippersnapper with the nincompoop friend thought they bamboozled the discombobulated security guard by hiding the stolen doohickey under your chair?

>Encourage people, simplify, and leverage public property

>If there were no connection between what happened in the past and what will happen in the future, we would be totally incapable of anticipating future events or thinking about the future at all.

>Numerous instances were identified during the scope period of the audit where vendors were created/changed and then subsequently paid by the same employee

>Accessibility for all devices and for all humans no matter what or where. Relevant content connecting to other relevant content. Searchable. Meaningful. OPEN!

>as in most early applications of LLMs, the systems are primarily viewed by executives as a quick and easy way to cut costs and automate systems already rife with problems, frustrated consumers, and underpaid and overtaxed support employees.

>Givens created an entire development model in which each community would have: 1) producer cooperatives (particularly important for job creation, 2) consumer cooperatives, 3) credit unions, 4) low-income housing cooperatives, and 5) a community cooperative funded by profits from the other cooperatives to develop social programs like schools, hospitals, and child development centers.

>Speak directly and shoot from the hip. Be real and be authentic. Be kind and be good to people. Share the lessons you’ve learned - good and bad. Laugh at yourself. Don't get pulled into negative sludge and never contribute to toxicity. Laugh at yourself some more. And always remember, the golden rule - It’s nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice

>knowledge is laughable when attributed to a human being

>We come up with all different types of excuses. Nobody cared. We all went to Clubhouse and blew this up. You know this guy went to the bank, got whatever he want.

>Nobody cares until the carelessness comes back to haunt them

>Spreadsheets are understood by everyone, so starting from there and converting CSV to other formats is the best way to build a shared knowledge base before moving into any format which cannot be read by an office productivity software suite.

>Create a comparison chart between the raw data and the canonical data prior to implementation. Simple unit tests can be used to verify the logic in the code. This will allow you to come to an agreement up front and avoid the process of creating multiple implementations, doing multiple presentations, and  creating multiple sources of technical debt. Tools such as the Wikidata Glossary and Topic Navigation Templates can be used as a transformation target to normalize data based on an international standard.

>Setup a voting system to determine the standards you will be using for numeric values, such as dates, times, and currency. Find numeric equivalents for non-numeric values, such as longitude and latitude coordinates for locations, or Unicode equivalents for emojis.

>your body can only digest and absorb so much protein at a time

>A key component to sustainable exercise adherence is finding activities that you truly enjoy

>Someone points out new rules make it too easy to cancel people over nothing, gets cancelled, seemingly, over this compliant

>Be explicit in code about the data retention, data structure, and data schema for each and every data point. A name and location for these details should be chosen which is persistent, consistent, and resistant to change, such as a pinboard, collaboration tool, or content management system of your choice. In addition, a Venn Diagram within the document can encapsulate both the relationships between data points and owners, as well as the relationships between owners and policies.

>A shared email address and shared calendar can be a better way to manage your team's schedule compared to ad hoc communication. Team members can then be informed ahead of time about important dates  and messages without putting too much burden on individuals to remember everything.

>Wrap the themes of your campaign in an interactive experience, or ask audiences for their opinions to begin your own community

>(don't) reach for the S.T.A.R.S.:
>S - Steroids
>T - Trauma
>A - Alcohol

>Create a playbook consisting of steps to read, write, and update each data point. If you have more than one source for a data point, add a step in the playbook to merge and normalize them down to a single source of truth. Research a Common Data Model (CDM) for your industry for non-numeric data. If one exists, take that into consideration, and if it is acceptable, come up with a process and schedule for migrating from your existing data model to a common data model. Otherwise, create a vocabulary document composed of a definition, synonyms, and antonyms to track changes to metadata over time.

>At any point in the processing of a stylesheet, there is a current template rule. Whenever a template rule is chosen by matching a pattern, the template rule becomes the current template rule for the instantiation of the rule's template. When an xsl:for-each element is instantiated, the current template rule becomes null for the instantiation of the content of the xsl:for-each element.

>Better information may actually cause individuals to invest less in their health and become less healthy

>While knowledge about the harms of smoking appears to explain about 15% of the relationship between education and smoking, knowledge about the harms of drinking do not explain differences in drinking by education.

>Just a few good questions about a program, and careful parsing of the answers, can clarify how well each of these elements is designed and aligns with the others — and lead to significantly better decisions

>If something is important enough to merit significant investment, it's also likely to be complicated enough that efficacy must be prioritized over ease.

>There was no diversity and almost no accuracy among the characters of color at all.

>the current status quo that fosters a climate of misclassification of millions of workers as overtime exempt which robs them both of wages and their own personal time

>If you are going to train the body in relation to its primary movements, there should be no isolated contractions

>Parents never stop worrying about their kids, but kids realise as they get older that they worry about their parents too.

>The only job you start at the top is digging a hole

>Establishing a balance between forward and backward mapping is a practical art, not a science of design. Clearly, such a balanced, prudent problem definition is not easy to achieve. It means hard work for policy designers, who are well advised to spend up to a third to half of the time allocated to analysis and design in finding and defining the ‘right’ problem.

>Culture will always eat strategy for lunch

>Change will not happen without power, negotiation, and influence.

>You will not solve any problem by settling

>I could do a lot better if you got me a real actor to work with.

>With some people, it's become an issue. I've had people look at me with total shock. Particularly if they hear my voice, because they think that all Black people have a voice that sounds a certain way, and they know it. And I sit there and go, "Oh yeah? Well, sorry, I don't"

>Moderate physical activity has a positive impact on the body because it helps maintain the health of bones, muscles, and joints.

>A in APL, brought to fruition by Morgan Stanley would later became K and ultimately Q,

>although short, intensive literacy courses may be able to bring an individual to a prescribed reading grade level, experience has consistently show that these skills will be lost unless constantly reinforced. What has been demonstrated about tank gunnery training is equally true of reading skills.

>The sinuses are lined with soft, pink tissue called mucosa, which serves to constantly cleanse the sinuses of impurities such as dust, dirt, allergens, pollutants and bacteria. To clear these inhaled pathogens, the sinus lining secretes mucus which is then cleared away by small, hair-like structures called cilia, which act in coordination to sweep the mucus through the sinus pathways and out through the back of the throat. 

>Brands are just tools for consumers to describe their personality

>When you're somebody like myself, in order to be attractive, you have to develop something, you have to learn something, you have to do something. So you become a bit more interesting.

>Toriyama entered the manga industry by submitting a work to an amateur contest

>Her timing, pace, drama, energy was perfect!

>Those are the ones who have purchased error [in exchange] for guidance, so their transaction has brought no profit, nor were they guided.

>The potential that ML offers for us is exciting, but even the best AI models introduce unexpected errors, were mostly trained on contemporary materials, and struggle when asked to process materials produced by people living in a time without computers. A classic example is image recognition systems that may label an object from a 19th century photograph a cellphone.

>We all just were in shock, and we looked at each other like, did we just hear that? ... Everybody was in shock — our cheerleaders, our students that were in that area that heard it clearly were just frozen

>accepted so fully as an equal (and so often admired as a superior)

>As far as I can see, we are the only professional sports league that self distributes across a high multiple of live social channels to drive top of the funnel discovery and engagement.

>People are putting all of their time and resources into technology owned by other companies--years of work could be lost in a moments time with no warning. I recognize there is a fine balance between being a user of a helpful program and developing true skill sets that will allow you to take ownership of your work outside of consumer generated media focused websites. It is essential to build your technical capacity and have ownership of your own platform, such as a personal website. This is a platform where your voice can be heard rather than relying on a community website--develop your own true fans and followings rather than relying on a corporation to do it for you.

>we love only what we do not possess

>Covert facilitation and escalation apply at many levels and go beyond efforts of formal societal control, They appear to be fundamental social processes inherent to contexts of strategic interaction and limited resources. At the primary group level, anyone who has connived to catch a child in an act of wrongdoing, offered leniency in return for good behavior, or punished the child by banishment to its room, only to have the room partly destroyed, is aware of this.

>When my mother died, we had to choose from a photo album of coffins. I couldn't leave Apryl to bury me in one of them, so I made my own.
